The various "empty" sounds all come from Counter-Strike Source, with the
exception of EMPTYR (Medal of Honor: Pacific Assault) and EMPTYH (freesound.org).

Flesh1 through Flesh5, Ric1 through Ric5, all come from Medal of Honor: Allied Assault.

Metlhit1-4 are borrowed from Reelism by kind permission of Kinsie.

Dssecret is from Street Fighter: The Movie: The Arcade Game by Capcom and
Incredible Technologies. (Apparently, that's Zangief, and that sound plays
whenever a credit is inserted into the machine.)

YOULOSE comes from Operation: Body Count by Capstone. Oddly, the scene that this
sound is attached to only seems to appear in the demo version!
