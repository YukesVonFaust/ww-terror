The Beretta Cutlass in this folder was edited by Mike12 of the ZDoom Forums.
I took matters into my own hands later on and added the hands to it,
in addition to trimming the individual bits into separate images
for animation purposes. The icon I'm using for burst fire...I'll be honest,
I have no idea where it comes from, aside from having seen it in one of
Laz Rojas' mods back in the day.
