The skill name graphics were made using the BMF font called DNS_NIBLE,
which was acquired from http://bmf.wz.cz/ and likely came from an
Amiga demoscene production or similar. I'm afraid I don't have more
information than that, sadly...

The AgencyHQ graphic came from a Google Image Search for "headquarters" and
is actually a photograph of the United States Census Bureau's headquarters
in Washington, DC, downloaded from www.census.gov.
