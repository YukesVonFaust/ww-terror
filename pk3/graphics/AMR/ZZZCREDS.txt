The Barrett M82A1 actually comes from screenshots of a model for
Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, which was created by
r2pp2r, twinke masta, Hav0c, Jennifer!!, Vunsunta, and kenlau.
I brought it into Paint Shop Pro for a little surgery (separating the magazine
from the weapon for animation purposes) and mild color correction to make
it look nicer in ZDoom. The muzzle flash in this folder is an enlarged
version of one from Blood by Monolith Software.
