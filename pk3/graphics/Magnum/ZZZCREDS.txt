These Mateba Unica Autorevolver graphics were actually drawn for me by
The_Funktasm of #zdoom. I do not know how he does it, people! =P

The graphics were originally given to me as a sheet of sprites; I disassembled
them and tweaked them until they were in the state they're in now.

Additional credits go to Xaser for some slight touchups to the carbine graphic
and for editing up the scope attachment (which I believe originally comes from
Shadow Warrior?).
