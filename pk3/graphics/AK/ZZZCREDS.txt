This Kalashnikov rifle was originally posted on the DRD Team folders
by a user named Necronixxus (I hope I spelled that right!). I did some
graphical surgery on it to separate the magazine from the weapon (for
animation purposes), and had to draw the entire grenade launcher from
scratch specifically for this mod. Seriously, it was a pain!
Therefore, _PLEASE_ ask me first before you decide to use the extra bits
of this weapon in a mod of your own.
