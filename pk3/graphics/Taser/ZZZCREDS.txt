This Taser (stungun) sprite was originally a remote detonator in
Blood: Plasma Pak, before The_Funktasm got his hands on it. I modified it
further to have MidoriMan's awesome leather-clad arms attached, which actually
required quite a lot of effort, as MidoriMan did not originally make
an arm that would fit the graphic.
