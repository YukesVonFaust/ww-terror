These hands were assembled by MidoriMan of the ZDoom forums (and later
disassembled by me). Some edits were made by me to keep things more consistent
with the weapons; the Handmat* graphics were taken into Rotsprite.

Portions of the hands come from HacX by Banjo Software, Blood by Monolith,
and id Software's original Doomguy hands.

And a special thanks to Kevin Cloud, whose arms are just about the hairiest
I've seen in a game, ever.
