A lot of this is subject to change as the mod is developed, but here goes.

THE PLAYER - Following in the footsteps of his grandfather, Some Guy With A Revolver,
this mod stars new protagonist, John SomeGuyWithAPistol, who is coincidentally
the same exact person as his grandfather, save for his choice of sidearm.
Terrorists killed his wife. He swears Bloody Revenge.

THE BIG BAD GUY - Nobody knows his true name, but his faction refers to him as
"Mr. Falcon." He comes equipped with tons of accessories like body armor,
a grenade launcher, and kung fu grip - collect them all!

ALBERT WESKER - I don't think he's in the right game.

THAT HOMELESS DUDE - Seen throughout the compound holding a cardboard sign and
an old tin cup. Rescue him with the Use key to get useful medical supplies.
(Don't worry, they're sterile!)
